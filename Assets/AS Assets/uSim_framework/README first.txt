After installing the package run function on Unity top menu "Window/usim/auto-configure inputs
This will install usim standard inputs. Restart project. 
If inputs are still missing. Copy the file "InputsManager.asset" located in "uSim_framework 1.3/Configuration files"
to "project folder/Project settings" and replace. Restart project. 
Mac users will have to do it manually. 
Some editor errors may pop up but it's not related to usim structure and it functioning. 
All errors shold go uppon clearing the console. 
If errors persist please contact me at gabriel.campitelli@gmail.com
For more information browse documentation on Documentation folder.

Thank you
